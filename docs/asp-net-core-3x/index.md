# ASP.NET Core 3.x and .NET 5

Starting ASP.NET Core 3.x ServiceComposer leverages the new Endpoints support to plugin into the request handling pipeline.
ServiceComposer can be added to existing or new ASP.NET Core projects, and to .NET Core console applications.

## Basic usage

To start using ServiceComposer refer to the [basic usage](basic-usage.md) section.

## Authentication and Authorization

By virtue of leveraging ASP.NET Core 3.x Endpoints ServiceComposer automatically supports authentication and authorization metadata attributes to express authentication and authorization requirements on routes. For more information refer to the [Authentication and Authorization](authentication-authorization.md) section
