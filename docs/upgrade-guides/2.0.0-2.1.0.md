## Write support

Starting with version 2.1.0, write support is enabled by default in `ServiceComposer.AspNetCore`. To disable it, use the following configuration option:

<!-- snippet: disable-write-support -->
<a id='snippet-disable-write-support'></a>
```cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddViewModelComposition(options => options.DisableWriteSupport());
}
```
<sup><a href='/src/Snippets/WriteSupport/EnableWriteSupport.cs#L9-L14' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-disable-write-support' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

When write support is disabled, `ServiceComposer.AspNetCore` will only respond to get requests.
