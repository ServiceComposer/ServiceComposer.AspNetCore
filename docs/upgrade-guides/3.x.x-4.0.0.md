## System.Text.Json support

The dependency on `Newtonsoft.Json` has been removed in favor of using the built-in `System.Text.Json`. Starting v4, ServiceComposer uses `System.Text.Json` to serialize view models to HTTP responses.

### Default view models use ExpandoObject instead of DynamicObject

`System.Text.Json` doesn't support serializing `DynamicObject`. The default view model is now `ExpandoObject`, instead of a custom class inhering from `DynamicObject`. This change should have no effects on user code as all previously-supported view model features were moved to the `ICompositionContext` in [v3](2.x.x-3.0.0.md).

Merging two view models using the `DynamicViewMode.Merge(dynamic)` method is not supported anymore.

### Custom serialization options

The `UseCustomJsonSerializerSettings` option now uses an instance of `JsonSerializerOptions`.
