# ASP.NET Core 3.x and .NET 5

Starting ASP.NET Core 3.x ServiceComposer leverages the new Endpoints support to plugin into the request handling pipeline.
ServiceComposer can be added to existing or new ASP.NET Core projects, or it can be hosted in .NET Core console applications.

## ASP.Net Model Binding

When handling composition requests it possible to leverage the power of ASP.Net Model Binding to bind incoming forms, bodies, query string parameters, or route data to strongly typed C# models. For more information on model binding refer to the [Model Binding](model-binding.md) section.

## Authentication and Authorization

By virtue of leveraging ASP.NET Core 3.x Endpoints ServiceComposer automatically supports authentication and authorization metadata attributes to express authentication and authorization requirements on routes. For more information refer to the [Authentication and Authorization](authentication-authorization.md) section

## Serialization

By default ServiceComposer serializes responses using the Newtonsoft JSON serializer. The built-in serialization support can be configured to seriazlie responses using a camel case or pascal case approach on a per request basis by adding to the request an `Accept-Casing` custom HTTP header. For more information refer to the [response serialization casing](response-serialization-casing.md) section. Or it's possible to take full control over the [response serialization settings on a case-by-case](custom-json-response-serialization-settings.md) by suppliying at configuration time a customization function.

Starting with version 1.9.0, regular MVC Output Formatters can be used to serialize the response model, and honor the `Accept` HTTP header set by clients. When using output formatters the serialization casing is controlled by the formatter configuration and not by ServiceComposer. For more information on using putput formatters refers to the [output formatters serialization section](output-formatters-serialization.md).
